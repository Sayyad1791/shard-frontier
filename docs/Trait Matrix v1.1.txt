Shard Frontier — Trait Matrix v1.1
Purpose Define rarity, evolution, and utility for Shard Frontier, covering Ore → Shards → Relics → Machine Parts, and the metadata schema that represents them across BlockDAG (testnet → mainnet) and future ETH/OKX collections. Updates in v1.1 reflect the latest gameplay, economy, and on-chain decisions; where conflicts exist, v1.1 supersedes v1.0. Baseline originated in v1.0. 
Scope of change from v1.0
	•	Formalizes Ore tiers and their finishes.
	•	Locks Shard tiers (ERC-721) and finish mapping; introduces proto-shards (SBT, in-game only).
	•	Establishes Block 1 combine costs and basic crafting matrix.
	•	Clarifies Trait Families as core (Solar/Quantum/Void/Genesis).
	•	Sets fair-play perk caps and mutation policy for Block 1.
	•	Distinguishes ERC-721 shards vs ERC-1155 parts.
	•	Confirms metadata attribute keys and image standards.

0) Phasing (for provenance & metadata)
	•	Phase 1 — Awakening (Testnet), two blocks (Block 1 is the demo scope).
	•	Phase 2 — Zeus (Testnet), two blocks.
	•	Phase 3 — TGE (Mainnet), two blocks. Use origin_phase and event_tag attributes to stamp provenance across phases.

1) Ore (gameplay materials)
Tiers & visual identity
	•	Dust Ore — Amber (common) → warm amber tones.
	•	Alloy Ore — Titanium/Silver (industrial) → high reflectance, brushed metal.
	•	Crystal Ore — Ion Teal/Blue (scarce) → crystalline, emissive teal/blue.
	•	Relic Ore — Iridescent/Holographic (ancient/event) → color-shifting, spectral.
Primary uses
	•	Dust: entry-level forging; fast early progression.
	•	Alloy: crafting Machine Parts (Mk I) and shard combining fees.
	•	Crystal: mid-tier shard combines (Rare).
	•	Relic: top-tier (Legendary) + future Relic recipes.
(v1.1 addition; v1.0 introduced materials conceptually but not as a fixed ore ladder.)

2) Shards (ERC-721 on BlockDAG)
Rarity tiers (unchanged labels, clarified usage)
	•	Raw → matte amber finish
	•	Refined → brushed titanium/silver
	•	Rare → crystalline prismatic (teal/blue)
	•	Legendary → iridescent/holographic
Functional axes Each shard has two function lines: functions.primary and functions.secondary from {Efficiency, Capacity, Speed, Control} (primary ≠ secondary).
Families (now core, not “future only”)
	•	Solar (efficiency tilt), Quantum (mobility/speed tilt), Void (control tilt), Genesis (commemorative/event). Stored as family_tag.
Proto-Shards (SBT, Block 1 only)
	•	Raw (proto) minted in-game only (soulbound / non-tradable).
	•	Used as inputs to forge Refined (tradable ERC-721). (New in v1.1; v1.0 did not formalize SBT proto stage.)
Block 1 progression & costs (Awakening demo)
	•	Forge Proto-Shard (Raw, SBT)
	◦	Inputs: 100 Dust or 40 Alloy (off-chain count).
	◦	Output: 1× Raw (proto); small milestone boost.
	•	Combine → Refined Shard (tradable ERC-721)
	◦	Inputs: 3× Raw (proto) + 50 Alloy + 0.10 BDAG mint fee.
	◦	Output: 1× Refined Shard (finish = brushed titanium).
	•	(Optional in Block 1) Rare Shard (tradable)
	◦	Inputs: 3× Refined + 1 Crystal + 0.20 BDAG.
	◦	Output: 1× Rare Shard (finish = crystalline).
	•	Legendary Shard deferred to later block (Relic ore required).
Mutation policy (Block 1)
	•	Cosmetic mutation chance 5% on Rare+ combines only (pattern/overlay).
	•	No stat changes from mutation in Block 1 (fairness). (Supersedes v1.0 generic mutation table for Block 1; keep v1.0 values as historical guidance.)

3) Relics (final ETH/OKX collection; future)
Definition “Frontier Relics” are ultimate collectibles bridged/minted on ETH/OKX (not in Block 1).
Indicative gate (documented, not implemented in Block 1)
	•	Inputs (example): 1× Legendary Shard + Full Part Set (Mk II+) + Season badge/event medal.
	•	Output: Frontier Relic NFT (ETH/OKX), strong provenance (origin_phase, event_tag).

4) Machine Parts (ERC-1155 later; account-bound in Block 1)
Vehicles: Miner → Hover Miner → Space Ship (later). Block 1 scope: Miner only; parts are account-bound (non-tradable) for demo simplicity.
	•	Mk I Part Recipes (starter)
Slot

Fair-play caps (Block 1)
	•	Total active perks ≤ +25%; per-axis soft cap +15%.
Melting down
	•	Refund 60% Alloy + 30% Dust of input materials.
Combining (preview)
	•	2× Mk I → Mk II (later block); gains +50% of lower part perk, consumes both + small Alloy fee.
(v1.1 adds concrete part economics; v1.0 listed trait categories and perk examples conceptually.)

5) Trait structure (consolidated)
Categories (v1.0, retained):
	•	Material (e.g., Ferrite Dust, BDAG Quartz, Ion Crystal) → influences palette/particles.
	•	Energy (Reactor Core, Flux Cell) → glow/animation intensity.
	•	Structural (Alloy Frame, Nano Mesh) → form/durability cues.
	•	Cognitive (AI Imprint, Memory Core) → lore hooks/narrative. 
Families (now core): Solar / Quantum / Void / Genesis (see §2). Functions: Efficiency, Capacity, Speed, Control (2 lines per shard). Finish by rarity: Raw/Refined/Rare/Legendary → matte amber / brushed titanium / crystalline (teal) / iridescent.

6) Metadata schema (NFT JSON)
Required keys
	•	name, description, image (ipfs://CID/path), attributes (array of { trait_type, value }).
Attribute keys for shards
	•	rarity: Raw | Refined | Rare | Legendary
	•	functions.primary, functions.secondary: from {Efficiency, Capacity, Speed, Control}
	•	finish: per rarity map above
	•	family_tag: Solar | Quantum | Void | Genesis
	•	origin_phase: Awakening | Zeus | TGE
	•	event_tag: e.g., Launch Week, Canyon Run Cup, Ion Tempest
	•	display_color: e.g., amber, silver, teal, holo
	•	(Optional for combines) mutation_flag, mutation_note, mutation_proof (hash)
	•	(Optional future awards) award_class, award_source, edition_size, ocw (bucket/value_pct/expires_at)
Image standards
	•	Shards: 1:1 (2048×2048) PNG/WebP; visual mapping by rarity/family.
	•	Parts: 1:1 (2048×2048), 3/4 renders.
	•	Relics (ETH): 1:1 or 3:4 (1536×2048) cinematic poster.
(v1.1 fixes attribute keys and adds optional fields consistent with v1.0’s NFT integration goal.)

7) Rarity weighting & function rolls
Default function-axis tilt (guidance for generator; adjustable by season)
	•	Raw: Efficiency-weighted (e.g., Eff/Cap/Speed/Control ≈ 60/20/15/5)
	•	Refined: 40/30/20/10
	•	Rare: 30/30/25/15
	•	Legendary: ~even 25/25/25/25
(Supersedes the generic v1.0 table for function bias while keeping v1.0 rarity/utility intent.)

8) Anti-duplication & provenance (unchanged intent)
	•	Each NFT stores a fusion hash derived from input shard IDs to prevent dupes.
	•	Verify randomness and fusion via auditable seeds; expose combine history in metadata. 

9) Economy & fairness notes (Block 1)
	•	On-chain scarcity is created primarily by combines (burning inputs).
	•	Perk caps prevent pay-to-win spikes; mutations are cosmetic in Block 1.
	•	Ore sinks (forging, parts, combines) ensure long-term economy health.

10) Open items / gaps to confirm
	•	ERC-721 Enumerable vs indexer: For inventory UX at scale, confirm whether we add Enumerable or rely on a lightweight indexer.
	•	Exact BDAG mint fees per tier (Refined = 0.10 BDAG set; Rare/Legendary later).
	•	Relic bridge spec (ETH/OKX): finalize method (L2 bridge vs custodial mint) and event badge proofs.
	•	DAO/award fields: confirm ocw (off-chain weight) usage and governance link in Phase 2+.
	•	Parts tradability: switch from account-bound to ERC-1155 tradable in later block; confirm royalty rules.

Version stamp
	•	Trait Matrix v1.1 — replaces/extends v1.0 where specified; other v1.0 content remains valid background.
