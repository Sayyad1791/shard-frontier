Trait Matrix v1.0 (Plain Text)
Purpose
Define the rarity, evolution, and utility framework for Shard Frontier NFTs and shards. This matrix governs how in-game resources evolve into blockchain assets and how each rarity tier supports long-term engagement and market value.

Trait Structure Overview
Every collectible or NFT in Shard Frontier is built from a combination of:
	•	Material Traits (the ores and shards used)
	•	Functional Traits (speed, efficiency, power)
	•	Visual Traits (colour, texture, pattern, holographic effects)
	•	Lore Traits (origin story or event badge)
Each trait contributes to rarity, appearance, and potential perks.

Core Rarity Tiers
Tier
Source
Description
Utility
Raw
Common ore
Abundant and low-yield materials; short-term use
Basic upgrades
Refined
Processed ore
Mid-tier crafting input
Unlocks mid-level tools
Rare
Deep-zone anomalies
Difficult to obtain; unique visual patterns
Enhanced gameplay bonuses
Legendary
Event or DAO drops
Extremely limited, story-tied items
Highest visual/lore value, tradable NFT tier

Trait Categories
Category
Examples
Description
Material
Ferrite Dust, BDAG Quartz, Ion Crystal
Determines colour palette and particle effects
Energy
Reactor Core, Flux Cell
Defines animation intensity and glow strength
Structural
Alloy Frame, Nano Mesh
Controls shape variance and durability
Cognitive
AI Imprint, Memory Core
Adds lore hooks and narrative metadata
Each crafted item draws randomly (weighted) from these categories to maintain uniqueness.

Trait Evolution (Fusion System)
	1	Collect Shards – obtained from mining or missions.
	2	Combine – fuse two or more shards in the Forge to create an evolved shard.
	3	Refine – use Energy Credits to stabilise the fusion; chance of mutation.
	4	Mint – once stabilised, mint the NFT (on BDAG or bridged chain).
Mutation adds a random bonus trait (colour shift, glow pattern, small stat buff). Higher rarity shards have increased mutation chance.

Weighting ensures longevity — players always have common finds but still chase high-rarity outcomes.

NFT Integration
	•	Minted NFTs inherit trait metadata directly from the shard combination.
	•	Metadata schema follows ERC-1155/721 hybrid standard.
	•	Rarity and fusion history visible on both BDAG explorer and Rarible storefront.
	•	Legendary and event NFTs include immutable “Creation Lore” lines (who forged it, during what event, DAO season, etc.).

Perk Examples by Trait Type
Trait
Example Perk
Material – Ion Crystal
+3 % mining speed
Energy – Flux Cell
+5 % reactor duration
Structural – Nano Mesh
+2 % hull integrity
Cognitive – Memory Core
Unlocks lore mission or hidden dialogue

Trait Families (Future Expansion)
	1	Solar Lineage – warm gold/amber tones; linked to energy efficiency.
	2	Quantum Lineage – blue/purple tones; boosts hover systems.
	3	Void Lineage – dark metallics; linked to DAO governance perks.
	4	Genesis Lineage – event-only, animated; visual prestige, no stat gain.
These families let future seasons add depth without breaking the existing economy.

Anti-Duplication & Rarity Assurance
	•	Each NFT stores a fusion hash derived from shard IDs to prevent duplicates.
	•	The system checks for identical trait combos before minting.
	•	DAO auditors can review randomness seed generators for transparency.

Visual & Thematic Direction
Clean BDAG-style design language: metallic gradients, luminescent edges, and animated particle loops for higher rarities. Even Raw-tier shards look collectible and “real.”

Deliverables for This Phase
	1	PDF – Trait Matrix v1.0
	2	Metadata Schema Draft (JSON template)
	3	Rarity Weight Table for future seasons
	4	Render Prompts – Shard variants (Raw → Legendary progression)
